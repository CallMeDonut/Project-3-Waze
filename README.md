# Project Overview
This project utilizes the WaZe dataset to predict user churn. It begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA) and includes feature engineering before building a machine learning model. I chose logistic regression for this initial approach and found that while the model lacks the strength for high-stakes decision-making, it can still provide valuable insights for further analysis. In the future, I plan to revisit this project for a deeper analysis and to experiment with additional models to improve performance.
